STOCK MARKET PREDICTION USING ENSEMBLE METHOD

Project Overview: This project focuses on predicting stock prices using ensemble learning techniques. By combining the strengths of multiple machine learning models, ensemble methods can produce more accurate and robust predictions. This project uses a combination of different models to improve prediction accuracy for stock price forecasting.

Introduction: Stock price prediction is a complex and highly volatile problem due to the random nature of financial markets. This project applies an ensemble learning approach to predict stock prices, combining multiple machine learning models to improve prediction performance and minimize errors.

Technologies Used: Google Colab Python Notebook Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn TensorFlow / Keras Pandas Numpy Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization

Dataset: The project uses historical stock price data, containing features such as: Open price High price Low price Close price Volume Adjusted close price The dataset can be sourced from Kaggle.

Approach: 1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess historical stock data. Handle missing values, normalize the dataset, and split it into training and testing sets.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize stock trends and check correlations between features.

3.Model Development: Train various machine learning models. Use ensemble techniques to combine the outputs of these models for better accuracy.

Results: The ensemble models provide better results compared to individual models, particularly in terms of lower prediction errors. Detailed performance metric such as RMSE for each model and the ensemble model are presented, along with visualizations of predicted vs actual stock prices.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning for stock price prediction. By aggregating multiple models, the ensemble method reduces prediction errors and enhances overall performance, making it a powerful tool for financial forecasting.
